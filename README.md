# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions for the different puzzles of the event named *Advent of Code*, 2023 edition. Each day has its own C# project in the solution.

Instead of writing the solutions in Rust, I'll be writing them in C#. Note that the participation is on best-efforts basis. Not all days may appear, although this shouldn't prevent you from taking a peek and get some inspiration.

Before looking at how I solved one particular puzzle, try solving it yourself first. It's way more fun.
