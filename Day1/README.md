## Summary
This puzzle requests the first and last digit of each line to form a number. The sum of all lines must then be given as a solution.

## Particularities
The final solution code is a mashup of the two parts together since the main body of the code is the same. To get part one, change the variable `corrected_line` to `line`. Instructions are provided in the `Program.cs` file.
